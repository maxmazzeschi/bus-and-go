# bus-and-go

This is a simple webapp to demonstrate how to use the public-transport-datasets python package available on https://pypi.org/project/public-transport-datasets/

Sources https://github.com/maxmazzeschi/public-transport-datasets

## How it works
bus and go will show you a map of your location (or defaults to Rome), then you have to select the Country and City.

Map will populate with bus vehicles in the area. 

Depending on the service provider you might have additional information as bearing (vehicle will appear as arrow in the driving direction) and current speed (as label).

If you zoom in enough, bus stops will be presented as flags (hover will show furhter details as name)

Route selector will help to refine visualization of the lines you're interested into.
